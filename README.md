## Introduction

Kavka is a **feature-rich**, **open-source** chat application developed with **GoLang**, and it is proudly hosted on GitHub. As an open-source project, Kavka welcomes contributors from all over the world to join the community and contribute their skills and expertise to make the application even better.

At Kavka, we believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. Our primary goal is to provide a platform where developers can not only connect and communicate but also enhance their programming skills and strive towards becoming senior programmers. We understand the importance of continuous growth in the ever-evolving field of technology, and Kavka aims to be a catalyst in that journey.

With a focus on learning, Kavka offers a range of features designed to challenge and expand developers' knowledge. From implementing real-time messaging using `websocket` to ensuring data security and encryption, Kavka provides an environment where developers can experiment with new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.
